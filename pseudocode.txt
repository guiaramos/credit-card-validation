Ask the credit card number to be checked.
  the get must accept only numbers, not hyphens or alpha.

Create a validation using Luhn's Algorithm.
  Declare integer for:
    copy of a number,
    the sum of the evens,
    the sum of the odds,
    current digit,
    last digit,
    number of digits,
  Make a copy of the number.
  While the copy number is greater than 0 make the loop.
    get the last digit of the numbers.
    assign to the last digit.
    check if the number of the current digit is odd or even.
      if even, increment the sum of the evens with the digit.
      else,
        create an integer to multiply the digit for 2.
        increment the sum of the odds with the multiplied number separated by digits.
      decrease the copy number.
      add the current digit.
    check if the sum of evens and odds remain 0 to validate.

  Getting the company name
    create integer first2digits with the current and last digit.
    if the current digit is equal to 4 and the number of digits is 13 or 15 and valid
      prompt VISA
    else if the first2digits is equal to 34 or 37, the length is 15 and valid
      prompt AMEX
    else if the first2digits is equal to 51, 52, 53, 54, or 55 and length 16 and valid
      prompt MASTERCARD
    else
     prompt INVALID
     return 1
